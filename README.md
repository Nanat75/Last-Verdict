#  ⚖️ Last Verdict - Web Phaser Game
### *A gothic morality-based judgement game*

</div>


> **Status:** 🚧 Work in Progress (WIP)

## 🕯️ Overview

**Last Verdict** is a narrative-driven judgement game set in a cathedral-like afterlife court.  
You awaken as a lost soul, granted one final chance to alter your fate by judging the wandering dead.

Each soul appears wearing a carved mask that represents their sin in life.  
They may plead, deceive, or lie — and it is your responsibility to decide:

**Redeem them… or condemn them.**

Your choices do not only affect the souls you judge  
they also shape **your own final fate**.

## 🎮 Core Concept & Gameplay

Set in a **gothic afterlife courtroom**, *Last Verdict* places you in the role of a silent judge, deciding the fate of masked souls who embody their sins.

-  Dark gothic courtroom in the afterlife  
-  Masked souls that visually react to lies and guilt  
-  Evidence-based investigations & interrogations  
-  Time-limited moral decisions  
-  Judgements affect corruption & moral alignment  
-  A hidden murderer storyline beneath the trials  
-  Multiple endings shaped by every verdict you deliver

## 🧠 Core Game Systems

| System | Description |
|------|------------|
| 📜 **Book of Life** | A detailed and sometimes *redacted* record of a soul’s actions. |
| ✉️ **Witness Letters** | Biased, emotional, or contradictory testimonies from the living and the dead. |
| 🎭 **Mask Reaction System** | Masks crack, glow, or distort when a soul lies or hides the truth. |
| 🗣️ **Interrogation** | Question souls directly and observe emotional tells and inconsistencies. |
| ⚖️ **Soul Ledger** | A cosmic balance tracking virtues versus sins. |
| 🪦 **Death Certificate** | Official records that may conceal or alter the truth. |
| ⏳ **Timed Judgement** | Decide **Redeem** or **Condemn** before the mask “sets.” |

These interconnected systems create a tense judgement loop where truth, doubt, and personal bias constantly collide.
